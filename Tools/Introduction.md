INTRODUCTION

Machine Learning is said as a subset of artificial intelligence that is mainly concerned with the development of algorithms which allow a computer to learn from the data and past experiences on their own. The term machine learning was first introduced by Arthur Samuel in 1959. 
With the help of sample historical data, which is known as training data, machine learning algorithms build a mathematical model that helps in making predictions or decisions without being explicitly programmed. Machine learning brings computer science and statistics together for creating predictive models. Machine learning constructs or uses the algorithms that learn from historical data. The more we will provide the information, the higher will be the performance.

Features of Machine Learning:
1. Machine learning uses data to detect various patterns in a given dataset.
2. It can learn from past data and improve automatically.
3. It is a data-driven technology.
4. Machine learning is much similar to data mining as it also deals with the huge amount of the data.

Classification of Machine Learning:

1. Supervised learning :- Supervised learning is a type of machine learning method in which we provide sample labeled data to the machine learning system in order to train it, and on that basis, it predicts the output.
The system creates a model using labeled data to understand the datasets and learn about each data, once the training and processing are done then we test the model by providing a sample data to check whether it is predicting the exact output or not.

Supervised learning can be grouped further in two categories of algorithms:
1. Classification
2. Regression

2) Unsupervised Learning :- Unsupervised learning is a learning method in which a machine learns without any supervision.
The training is provided to the machine with the set of data that has not been labeled, classified, or categorized, and the algorithm needs to act on that data without any supervision. The goal of unsupervised learning is to restructure the input data into new features or a group of objects with similar patterns.

Unsupervised Learning can be further classifieds into two categories of algorithms:
1. Clustering
2. Association

3) Reinforcement Learning
Reinforcement learning is a feedback-based learning method, in which a learning agent gets a reward for each right action and gets a penalty for each wrong action. The agent learns automatically with these feedbacks and improves its performance. In reinforcement learning, the agent interacts with the environment and explores it.
The robotic dog, which automatically learns the movement of his arms, is an example of Reinforcement learning.

Applications of Machine learning :-
1. Image Recognition
2. Speech Recognition
3. Traffic prediction
4. Product recommendations
5. Self-driving cars
6. Email Spam and Malware Filtering
7. Online Fraud Detection
8. Stock Market trading

Data Preprocessing in Machine learning
Data preprocessing is a process of preparing the raw data and making it suitable for a machine learning model. It is the first and crucial step while creating a machine learning model.
When creating a machine learning project, it is not always a case that we come across the clean and formatted data. And while doing any operation with data, it is mandatory to clean it and put in a formatted way. So for this, we use data preprocessing task.

Data Preprocessing involves below steps:
1. Getting the dataset
2. Importing libraries
3. Importing datasets
4. Finding Missing Data
5. Encoding Categorical Data
6. Splitting dataset into training and test set
7. Feature scaling
