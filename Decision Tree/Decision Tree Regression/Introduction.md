Decision Tree is a Supervised learning technique that can be used for both classification and Regression problems, but mostly it is preferred for solving Classification problems. It is a tree-structured classifier, where internal nodes represent the features of a dataset, branches represent the decision rules and each leaf node represents the outcome.

In a Decision tree, there are two nodes, which are the Decision Node and Leaf Node. Decision nodes are used to make any decision and have multiple branches, whereas Leaf nodes are the output of those decisions and do not contain any further branches.

Important Terminology related to Decision Trees :-

1. Root Node: It represents the entire population or sample and this further gets divided into two or more homogeneous sets.
2. Splitting: It is a process of dividing a node into two or more sub-nodes.
3. Decision Node: When a sub-node splits into further sub-nodes, then it is called the decision node.
4. Leaf / Terminal Node: Nodes do not split is called Leaf or Terminal node.
5. Pruning: When we remove sub-nodes of a decision node, this process is called pruning. You can say the opposite process of splitting.
6. Branch / Sub-Tree: A subsection of the entire tree is called branch or sub-tree.
7. Parent and Child Node: A node, which is divided into sub-nodes is called a parent node of sub-nodes whereas sub-nodes are the child of a parent node.

Advantages of the Decision Tree :-
1. It is simple to understand as it follows the same process which a human follow while making any decision in real-life.
2. It can be very useful for solving decision-related problems.
3. It helps to think about all the possible outcomes for a problem.
4. There is less requirement of data cleaning compared to other algorithms.

Disadvantages of the Decision Tree :-
1. The decision tree contains lots of layers, which makes it complex.
2. It may have an overfitting issue, which can be resolved using the Random Forest algorithm.
3. For more class labels, the computational complexity of the decision tree may increase.
