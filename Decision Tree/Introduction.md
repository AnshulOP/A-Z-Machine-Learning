Decision Tree is a Supervised learning technique that can be used for both classification and Regression problems, but mostly it is preferred for solving Classification problems. It is a tree-structured classifier, where internal nodes represent the features of a dataset, branches represent the decision rules and each leaf node represents the outcome.

In a Decision tree, there are two nodes, which are the Decision Node and Leaf Node. Decision nodes are used to make any decision and have multiple branches, whereas Leaf nodes are the output of those decisions and do not contain any further branches.

Important Terminology related to Decision Trees :-

1. Root Node: It represents the entire population or sample and this further gets divided into two or more homogeneous sets.
2. Splitting: It is a process of dividing a node into two or more sub-nodes.
3. Decision Node: When a sub-node splits into further sub-nodes, then it is called the decision node.
4. Leaf / Terminal Node: Nodes do not split is called Leaf or Terminal node.
5. Pruning: When we remove sub-nodes of a decision node, this process is called pruning. You can say the opposite process of splitting.
6. Branch / Sub-Tree: A subsection of the entire tree is called branch or sub-tree.
7. Parent and Child Node: A node, which is divided into sub-nodes is called a parent node of sub-nodes whereas sub-nodes are the child of a parent node.

Attribute Selection Measures :-
While implementing a Decision tree, the main issue arises that how to select the best attribute for the root node and for sub-nodes. So, to solve such problems there is a technique which is called as Attribute selection measure or ASM. By this measurement, we can easily select the best attribute for the nodes of the tree. There are two popular techniques for ASM, which are:

1. Information Gain
2. Gini Index

Information Gain : 
Information gain is the measurement of changes in entropy after the segmentation of a dataset based on an attribute.
It calculates how much information a feature provides us about a class.
According to the value of information gain, we split the node and build the decision tree.
A decision tree algorithm always tries to maximize the value of information gain, and a node/attribute having the highest information gain is split first. 

It can be calculated using the below formula:-
Information Gain= Entropy(S)- [(Weighted Avg) *Entropy(each feature)  

Entropy: Entropy is a metric to measure the impurity in a given attribute. It specifies randomness in data. Entropy can be calculated as:

Entropy(s)= -P(yes)log2 P(yes)- P(no) log2 P(no)

Where,
S= Total number of samples.
P(yes)= probability of yes.
P(no)= probability of no.

Gini Index:
Gini index is a measure of impurity or purity used while creating a decision tree in the CART(Classification and Regression Tree) algorithm.
An attribute with the low Gini index should be preferred as compared to the high Gini index.
It only creates binary splits, and the CART algorithm uses the Gini index to create binary splits.

Gini index can be calculated using the below formula:
Gini Index= 1- âˆ‘jPj2

Assumptions while creating Decision Tree :-
1. In the beginning, the whole training set is considered as the root.
2. Feature values are preferred to be categorical. If the values are continuous then they are discretized prior to building the model.
3. Records are distributed recursively on the basis of attribute values.
4. Order to placing attributes as root or internal node of the tree is done by using some statistical approach.

Advantages of the Decision Tree :-
1. It is simple to understand as it follows the same process which a human follow while making any decision in real-life.
2. It can be very useful for solving decision-related problems.
3. It helps to think about all the possible outcomes for a problem.
4. There is less requirement of data cleaning compared to other algorithms.

Disadvantages of the Decision Tree :-
1. The decision tree contains lots of layers, which makes it complex.
2. It may have an overfitting issue, which can be resolved using the Random Forest algorithm.
3.For more class labels, the computational complexity of the decision tree may increase.
