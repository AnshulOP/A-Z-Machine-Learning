                                                          Simple Linear Regression

Simple Linear Regression is a type of Regression algorithms that models the relationship between a dependent variable and a single independent variable. The relationship shown by a Simple Linear Regression model is linear or a sloped straight line, hence it is called Simple Linear Regression.

The key point in Simple Linear Regression is that the dependent variable must be a continuous/real value. However, the independent variable can be measured on continuous or categorical values.

Simple Linear regression algorithm has mainly two objectives:

1. Model the relationship between the two variables. Such as the relationship between Income and expenditure, experience and Salary, etc.
2. Forecasting new observations. Such as Weather forecasting according to temperature, Revenue of a company according to the investments in a year, etc.
 
Simple Linear Regression Model:

The Simple Linear Regression model can be represented using the below equation : y= a0+a1x+ ε 

Where,
1. a0= It is the intercept of the Regression line (can be obtained putting x=0).
2. a1= It is the slope of the regression line, which tells whether the line is increasing or decreasing. 
3. ε = The error term. (For a good model it will be negligible).
