                                                          Ridge Regression
Ridge regression is a type of regularization technique used in linear regression models. In traditional linear regression, the goal is to find a set of coefficients that best fit the training data, with the objective of minimizing the sum of squared errors between the predicted values and the actual values. However, in many cases, the resulting model may be too complex and overfit the training data, leading to poor generalization performance on new, unseen data.

Ridge regression addresses this issue by adding a regularization term to the objective function. The regularization term is based on the sum of squared values of the model's coefficients, multiplied by a regularization parameter, lambda. The goal of ridge regression is to find the set of coefficients that minimize the sum of squared errors plus the regularization term.

The effect of the regularization term is to shrink the coefficients towards zero, which makes the resulting model less complex and less likely to overfit the training data. The amount of shrinkage is controlled by the value of lambda, with larger values leading to more shrinkage and smaller values leading to less shrinkage.     

The objective function for ridge regression can be written as:

    minimize ||y - Xw||^2 + lambda * ||w||^2,

    where:

    y is the vector of target values
    X is the matrix of predictor variables
    w is the vector of coefficients to be estimated
    ||.||^2 denotes the squared Euclidean norm
    lambda is the regularization parameter
    
Ridge regression is particularly useful in situations where there are many correlated predictor variables, also known as multicollinearity. In such cases, traditional linear regression may produce coefficients that are sensitive to small changes in the data, which can lead to instability and poor generalization performance. Ridge regression helps to mitigate this problem by reducing the impact of correlated predictors and producing more stable coefficients.

There are several ways to implement ridge regression in machine learning, including using closed-form solutions or iterative optimization algorithms. In general, ridge regression is a powerful and widely used technique for improving the performance of linear regression models and preventing overfitting.
