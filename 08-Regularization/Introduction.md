                                                          Regularization
In machine learning, regularization is a technique used to prevent overfitting, which is when a model becomes too complex and starts to fit the training data too closely. Overfitting can lead to poor generalization performance, where the model does not perform well on new, unseen data.

Regularization works by adding a penalty term to the model's loss function that discourages it from fitting the training data too closely. This penalty term is based on the model's parameters, such as the weights in a neural network. The idea is to encourage the model to learn simpler, smoother patterns that are more likely to generalize well to new data.

There are several ways to implement regularization in machine learning, including L1 regularization, L2 regularization, and dropout. L1 regularization adds a penalty term based on the absolute values of the parameters, while L2 regularization adds a penalty term based on the squared values of the parameters. Dropout randomly drops out some neurons during training to prevent the model from relying too heavily on any one feature.

Regularization is an important technique in machine learning that helps to improve the generalization performance of models. By encouraging simpler, smoother patterns, regularization can help models to avoid overfitting and achieve better performance on new, unseen data.
