                                                        Elastic Net Regression
Elastic Net regression is a type of linear regression that combines the L1 and L2 regularization techniques of Lasso and Ridge regression. It is often used in machine learning applications where the number of features is large relative to the number of training examples, and there may be correlations among the features.

In Elastic Net regression, the objective function is a combination of the L1 and L2 penalty terms, which control the amount of regularization applied to the model. The L1 penalty term encourages sparsity in the model by shrinking some coefficients to zero, while the L2 penalty term encourages small but non-zero coefficients by shrinking all coefficients towards zero.

The Elastic Net objective function is defined as:

    minimize:
    (1/2) * sum((y - Xb)^2) + alpha * rho * sum(abs(b)) + (alpha * (1 - rho) / 2) * sum(b^2)
    Here, y is the target variable, X is the feature matrix, b is the coefficient vector, alpha is the regularization strength, and rho is the mixing parameter that         controls the balance between L1 and L2 regularization.
    
When rho is set to 1, Elastic Net reduces to Lasso regression, while when rho is set to 0, Elastic Net reduces to Ridge regression. In practice, a value of rho between 0 and 1 is used to balance the strengths of L1 and L2 regularization.

Elastic Net regression is useful when there are many correlated features in the data, as Lasso regression tends to arbitrarily select one feature from a group of correlated features, while Elastic Net can select all of them by jointly shrinking their coefficients. This can lead to better predictive performance and more interpretable models.

Like Lasso and Ridge regression, the strength of regularization in Elastic Net is controlled by the alpha parameter. Higher values of alpha lead to stronger regularization, which can help prevent overfitting in models with many features. Cross-validation can be used to choose the optimal value of alpha for a given dataset.

In summary, Elastic Net regression is a regularization technique that combines the L1 and L2 regularization techniques of Lasso and Ridge regression. It is useful when there are many correlated features in the data and can lead to better predictive performance and more interpretable models. The balance between L1 and L2 regularization is controlled by the mixing parameter rho, and the strength of regularization is controlled by the alpha parameter.
