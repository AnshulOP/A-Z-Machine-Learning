                                                            Column Transformer
The ColumnTransformer is a class in the scikit-learn library that is used to apply different preprocessing steps to different subsets of the data, based on the names or indices of the columns in the data. It allows you to specify which preprocessing steps should be applied to which columns in a concise and readable manner.

For example, you might have a dataset with both numerical and categorical columns, and you want to apply different preprocessing steps to each type of column. You might want to scale the numerical columns and one-hot encode the categorical columns, for example. With the ColumnTransformer, you can do this easily and efficiently.

The ColumnTransformer is constructed using a list of tuples, where each tuple represents a preprocessing step. The tuples contain the following elements:

1. The name of the step, as a string
2. The preprocessor object to be applied, such as a StandardScaler or OneHotEncoder
3. The specification of which columns the preprocessor should be applied to, either as column indices or column names.

For example, the following code would apply a StandardScaler to the first 10 columns of the data and a OneHotEncoder to the remaining columns:

    from sklearn.compose import ColumnTransformer

    from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler, OneHotEncoder

    ct = ColumnTransformer(

        transformers=[
    
            ('num', StandardScaler(), slice(0,10)),
        
            ('cat', OneHotEncoder(), slice(10, None))
    ])
