                                                             Handeling Outliers
Handling outliers refers to the process of identifying and modifying or removing extreme values in a dataset that are significantly different from the majority of the observations. Outliers can have a negative impact on the performance of machine learning algorithms, so handling them can improve the accuracy of the model's predictions. There are several techniques that can be used to handle outliers, including winsorization, truncation, log transformation, Box-Cox transformation, and Z-score normalization. The choice of technique depends on the characteristics of the data, the type of machine learning model being used, and the goals of the analysis.

Some of the most used techniques are :-
1. Z-SCORE Outlier Detection - Z-score outlier detection is a method for identifying outliers in a dataset by calculating the Z-score for each observation and flagging any observations that have a Z-score that is above a certain threshold. The Z-score is a measure of the number of standard deviations a given value is away from the mean of the data. This method is useful because it standardizes the data, making it easier to compare the magnitude of the outliers to the rest of the data. Additionally, it is robust to the scale of the data, so it can be used with data that has different units or scales. It's important to note that Z-score outlier detection assumes that the data follows a normal distribution, so it may not be the best method for data that is not normally distributed. In those cases, other methods, such as the modified Z-score method or the interquartile range method, may be more appropriate.
2. IQR Outlier Detection - IQR (Interquartile Range) outlier detection is a method for identifying outliers in a dataset by calculating the IQR for each observation and flagging any observations that fall outside of a specified range. The IQR is a measure of the spread of the middle 50% of the data. This method is useful because it is not sensitive to the scale of the data, so it can be used with data that has different units or scales. Additionally, it is robust to the shape of the data, so it can be used with data that does not follow a normal distribution. It's important to note that IQR outlier detection assumes that the data is symmetric and does not have a large number of extreme values, so it may not be the best method for data that is highly skewed or has a large number of outliers. In those cases, other methods, such as Z-score outlier detection or the modified Z-score method, may be more appropriate.
3. Percentile Outlier Detection - Percentile outlier detection is a method for identifying outliers in a dataset by calculating the percentiles of the data and flagging any observations that fall outside of a specified range. The percentiles divide the data into 100 equal parts. This method is useful because it is not sensitive to the scale of the data, so it can be used with data that has different units or scales. Additionally, it is robust to the shape of the data, so it can be used with data that does not follow a normal distribution. It's important to note that percentile outlier detection assumes that the data is symmetric and does not have a large number of extreme values, so it may not be the best method for data that is highly skewed or has a large number of outliers. In those cases, other methods, such as Z-score outlier detection or the modified Z-score method, may be more appropriate.
