# Machine Learning 
This repository contains the code related to machine learning knowledge.
Each code has been provided from start to end with systematical vew of each concept that you will need in your journey of learning ML.

Codes will be updated periodically in consideration to future changes in the code and more helping tools will be added for your help.

The dataset used in the algorithms is already refined i.e it is already passed through the stages of data cleaning and data preprocessing for the ease of understanding. There will be more projects and parts where Exploratory Data Analysis and data preprocessing is done on a completely raw data so, you dont have to worry about the previous stages of model contruction.

Enjoy Machine Learning!
