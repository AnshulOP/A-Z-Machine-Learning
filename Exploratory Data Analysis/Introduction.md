                                                         Exploratory Data Analysis

Exploratory data analysis was promoted by John Tukey to encourage statisticians to explore data, and possibly formulate hypotheses that might cause new data collection and experiments. EDA focuses more narrowly on checking assumptions required for model fitting and hypothesis testing. It also checks while handling missing values and making transformations of variables as needed.filling the counts with

EDA build a robust understanding of the data, issues associated with either the info or process. it’s a scientific approach to get the story of the data.

Types of Exploratory Data Analysis :-

1. Univariate Non-graphical
2. Multivariate Non-graphical
3. Univariate graphical
4. Multivariate graphical

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is an approach to analyze the data using visual techniques. It is used to discover trends, patterns, or to check assumptions with the help of statistical summary and graphical representations. 

Why Exploratory Data Analysis is important? 
1. Properly mapping your data ensures that you maintain high data quality when transferring it from its source to your database, spreadsheet, data warehouse, etc. Understanding how your data is structured means you can avoid mistakes from creeping in. 
2. Before diving in with a full analysis, it’s important to make sure any assumptions or hypotheses you’re working on stand up to scrutiny. While an EDA won’t give you all the details, it will help you spot if you’re inferring the right outcomes based on your understanding of the data. If not, then you know that your assumptions are wrong, or that you are asking the wrong questions about the dataset.
3. When carrying out any data analysis, it’s necessary to identify the importance of different variables. This includes how they relate to each other. For example, which independent variables affect which dependent variables? Determining this early on will help you extract the most useful information later on.
4. When carrying out your full analysis, you’ll need to remove any extraneous information. This is because needless additional data can either skew your results or simply obscure key insights with unnecessary noise. In pursuit of your goal, aim to include the fewest number of necessary variables. EDA helps identify information that you can extract.
5. EDA isn’t just about finding helpful information. It’s also about determining which data might lead to unavoidable errors in your later analysis. Knowing which data will impact your results helps you to avoid wrongly accepting false conclusions or incorrectly labeling an outcome as statistically significant when it isn’t.

In data analytics terms, we can generally say that exploratory data analysis is a qualitative investigation, not a quantitative one. This means that it involves looking at a dataset’s inherent qualities with an inquisitive mindset. Usually, it does not attempt to make cold measurements or draw insights about a dataset’s content.
