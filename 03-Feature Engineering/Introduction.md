                                                            Feature Engineering

Feature engineering is the pre-processing step of machine learning, which is used to transform raw data into features that can be used for creating a predictive model using Machine learning or statistical Modelling. Feature engineering in machine learning aims to improve the performance of models.

Feature engineering is a machine learning technique that leverages data to create new variables that arenâ€™t in the training set. It can produce new features for both supervised and unsupervised learning, with the goal of simplifying and speeding up data transformations while also enhancing model accuracy. Feature engineering is required when working with machine learning models. Regardless of the data or architecture, a terrible feature will have a direct impact on your model.

Different types of Feature Engineering are :-
1. Feature Transformation
2. Feature Construction
3. Feature Selection
4. Feature Extraction

Need for Feature Engineering in Machine Learning :-

1. Better features mean flexibility - In machine learning, we always try to choose the optimal model to get good results. However, sometimes after choosing the wrong model, still, we can get better predictions, and this is because of better features. The flexibility in features will enable you to select the less complex models. Because less complex models are faster to run, easier to understand and maintain, which is always desirable.
2. Better features mean simpler models - If we input the well-engineered features to our model, then even after selecting the wrong parameters (Not much optimal), we can have good outcomes. After feature engineering, it is not necessary to do hard for picking the right model with the most optimized parameters. If we have good features, we can better represent the complete data and use it to best characterize the given problem.
3. Better features mean better results - As already discussed, in machine learning, as data we will provide will get the same output. So, to obtain better results, we must need to use better features.
