                                                            ravel() function
The ravel function is a numpy method that is used to flatten a multi-dimensional array into a one-dimensional array. It returns a flattened view of the original array, meaning it does not create a new array in memory. The flattened array has the same data as the original array, but the shape of the array is changed to one dimension.

The primary use of the ravel function is to simplify the manipulation of multi-dimensional arrays in NumPy. Many machine learning algorithms require one-dimensional input data, and using the ravel function can help reshape multi-dimensional arrays into the required format.

For example, consider a 2-dimensional array :

    import numpy as np

    arr = np.array([[1, 2], [3, 4]])
    print(arr)
    
    Output: [[1 2]
            [3 4]]
Using the ravel function, we can flatten this 2-dimensional array into a 1-dimensional array :

    flattened = arr.ravel()
    print(flattened)
    
    Output: [1 2 3 4]    
The ravel function is also useful for concatenating multi-dimensional arrays. For example, if we have two 2-dimensional arrays and we want to concatenate them into a single 1-dimensional array, we can use the ravel function to flatten each array and then concatenate them :  

    arr1 = np.array([[1, 2], [3, 4]])
    arr2 = np.array([[5, 6], [7, 8]])

    concatenated = np.concatenate((arr1.ravel(), arr2.ravel()))
    print(concatenated)
    
    Output: [1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8]
Overall, the ravel function is a useful tool for manipulating multi-dimensional arrays in NumPy, and it can simplify data preparation for machine learning algorithms.
