                                                          Handling Missing Values
Missing values in the data can be handled in two ways :
1. By removing them
2. By imputing them

When we remove rows with missing values in our data it is known as Complete Case Analysis. It is not always recommended to use this method as it can result iin huge loss of useful data that might be useful in our ML model.

On the other hand imputing the missing values means when we replace the null values in our data with some pattern or any mathematically calculated value like mean, median or most frequently occuring value etc.

There are two types of imputing techniques :
1. Univariate
2. Multivariate
