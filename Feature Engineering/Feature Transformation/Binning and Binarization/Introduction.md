                                                           Binning and Binarization
1. Binning : Binning is the process of transforming continous variables into discrete variables by creating a set of contiguous intervals that span the range pf the variable values. Bin is known as the alternative name of interval. ANother name for binning is discretization.

Why do we use Binning?
1. To handle outliers
2. To improve the value spread

Types of Binning :-

1. Unsupervised Binning :- Equal width binning (uniform binning), Equal frequency binning (quantile binning), KMeans Binning  
2. Supervised Binning :- Decision Tree Binning
3. Custom Binning

We mostly use binning in most cases and in particular unsupervised binning and if there is availability of domain knowledge, then one can use custom binning.

2. Binarization : Binarization is used when you want to convert a numerical feature vector into a Boolean vector. In the field of digital image processing, image binarization is the process by which a color or grayscale image is transformed into a binary image, that is, an image with only two colors (typically, black and white).
This technique is used for the recognition of objects, shapes, and, specifically, characters. Through binarization, it is possible to distinguish the object of interest from the background on which it is found. Skeletonization is instead an essential and schematic representation of the object, which generally preludes the subsequent real recognition.
